# Join Our Sleep and Circadian Sciences Research!

<hr>

Are you passionate about sleep and circadian sciences? If you live in
Izmir, Turkey, and are curious about your light exposure and sleep
patterns, we invite you to volunteer in our research. Participate in our
questionnaires or field studies to contribute to groundbreaking
discoveries.

**Contact us today to explore these exciting opportunities!**

# Research areas

<hr>

-   **Creating Brighter Homes for All Species**

The project aims to investigate and standardize methods for measuring
light exposure tailored to different species. By doing so, it seeks to
regulate and optimize housing conditions for pets, farm animals, and lab
animals, ensuring their well-being and health.

-   **Ecological Vision: Understanding Animal Vision and the Impact of
    Light Pollution**

The project aims to investigate the photoreceptor sensitivities and lens
light transmissions of various species. By understanding these visual
mechanisms, it seeks to calculate and assess the ecological impact of
light pollution, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental
conservation strategies.

-   **Measuring Light Exposure and Sensitivities in Everyday Life**

The project involves developing wearable melanopic lux monitors to
measure personal light exposure in real-world settings. Additionally, we
are creating mobile apps to collect data on sleep, behavior, mood, and
cognitive functions in everyday life. This comprehensive approach allows
us to investigate the effects of light on various aspects of daily
living.

-   **Enhancing Health and Aging through Better Sleep**

The project aims to investigate the associations between aging
trajectories of sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, health, cognition,
and mood. By understanding these relationships, the project seeks to
develop targeted interventions that promote healthier aging.

-   **Illuminating Minds: Optimizing Light Exposure in Educational
    Environments**

The project aims to enhance cognitive performance and improve sleep
health by optimizing light exposure in educational settings. By
tailoring lighting conditions, it seeks to create an environment
conducive to both learning and overall well-being.

-   **Harmonizing Rhythms: Cultural Adaptation in Sleep and Circadian
    Research**

The project focuses on translating, validating, and adapting surveys and
methodologies to account for cultural variations, thereby enhancing the
meta-science and reproducibility of sleep and circadian research. This
ensures that findings are robust and applicable across diverse cultural
contexts.

# Collaborations

<hr>

-   MeLiDos - A prospective, multi-centric, cross-sectional cohort study
    to assess personal light exposure; funded by the European
    Partnership on Metrology, co-financed by the European Unionâ€™s
    Horizon.

-   Timing of eating behavior in older adults; collaboration with Mass
    General Research Institute, Harvard Medical School.

-   Measuring effects of light on mood in everyday life; collaboration
    with The University of Manchester, Division of Neuroscience, funded
    by BBSRC and Signify.
